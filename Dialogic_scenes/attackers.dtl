jamie (jamie_talking): There have been so many influential cyberattacks and viruses over the years.\
Which one do you want to hear about?
- Tell me about early viruses like the "ILOVEYOU" virus.
	James (James_talking): Tell me about early viruses like the "ILOVEYOU" virus.
	jamie: "Ah, the ILOVEYOU virus from 2000 ‚Äî one of the most destructive ever!\
It was a simple email with the subject line 'I LOVE YOU.' When people opened the attached file, the virus would overwrite files and send itself to everyone in the victim‚Äôs email contacts.
	jamie: It caused around $10 billion in damages worldwide!"
	James: "That‚Äôs insane! It was so simple but so powerful!"
	jamie: "Exactly ‚Äî it taught the world that humans, not just technology, are often the weakest link."

- Tell me about ransomware attacks like "WannaCry."
	James (James_talking): Tell me about ransomware attacks like "WannaCry."
	jamie: "WannaCry in 2017 was pure chaos. It used a Windows vulnerability to spread super fast. Once infected, computers were locked up ‚Äî people had to pay a ransom in Bitcoin to unlock them."
	James (James_talking): "And hospitals were hit too, right?"
	jamie: "Yeah. Hospitals in the UK had to cancel surgeries because of it. It showed how cyberattacks could risk real human lives."
	jump 
- Tell me about cyberattacks targeting companies, like Sony or Equifax.
	James: Tell me about cyberattacks targeting companies, like Sony or Equifax.
	jamie: "Alright, corporate hacks.\
First, the Sony Pictures hack in 2014 ‚Äî hackers stole confidential emails, movies, and employee info. It was political, linked to a movie mocking North Korea."
	James (James_talking): "Whoa, so even Hollywood isn‚Äôt safe?"
	jamie: "Not at all. Then there‚Äôs the Equifax breach in 2017 ‚Äî where hackers stole private info of 147 million Americans. Names, Social Security numbers... everything."
	James (James_talking): "That's terrifying!"
	jump 
- Tell me about cyberweapons like "Stuxnet."
	James (James_talking): Tell me about cyberweapons like "Stuxnet."
	jamie: "Now for the real spy movie stuff\: Stuxnet.\
It was discovered in 2010 and targeted Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities. Instead of stealing data, it sabotaged physical equipment ‚Äî damaging nuclear centrifuges."
	James (James_talking): "Cyberattacks can cause real-world destruction?"
	jamie: "Exactly. Stuxnet changed the entire idea of cyber warfare ‚Äî no more just stealing data, but attacking critical infrastructure."
	jump 
- Ask where to go
	James: Uh... excuse me. Where am I supposed to go
	jamie: Welcome, James. You're Scheduled for a Information Security Meeting
	jamie: Head down this hallway, take a right, and look for the room with the blue door.
- Im done listening for now
	James (James_talking): "Wow, Jamie... I had no idea there were so many cyberattacks, and that even simple viruses could cause billions of dollars in damage."
	jamie: "Yep. It‚Äôs crazy, right? Each attack taught the cybersecurity world a painful lesson ‚Äî about vulnerabilities, human error, and even politics."
	James (James_talking): "It‚Äôs not just about computers, is it? Cyberattacks affect real people, companies, even entire countries."
	jamie: "Exactly. Cybersecurity isn‚Äôt just technical ‚Äî it‚Äôs personal, economic, and political. Every year, attacks get more advanced, and defenses have to keep evolving."
	James (James_talking): "I guess learning about past cyberattacks is like studying history ‚Äî you need to know the past to defend the future."
	jamie: "Couldn‚Äôt have said it better! üíªüõ°Ô∏è\
And who knows? Maybe one day you‚Äôll be the one stopping the next big attack."
	James: "Yeah... or at least I‚Äôll know not to open an email saying 'I LOVE YOU' from a stranger!"
