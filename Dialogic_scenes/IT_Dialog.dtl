James: "Hey, I just got a phishing email pretending to be from the boss. Jordan told me to report it right away."
Good call. Show me.
(James pulls up the email. The IT staff leans in, skims it for about two seconds.)
Yeah, that’s phishing. No doubt.
James: Knew something was off.
Thanks for acting fast. We’ll block the sender and alert the team.
James: Glad I caught it early.
