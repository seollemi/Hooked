Hey James, can I ask for a quick favor?
James: Sure, what's up?
I'm trying to set up a password for my account here at the computer desk, but I'm not sure if it's strong enough. Can you help me check?
James (James_talking): Yeah, no problem. What password do you have in mind?
Well, I was thinking something like "ronnie1234." What do you think?
James (James_talking): Hmm, honestly, that's pretty weak. It's easy to guess because it uses your name and a simple number sequence.
Oh, really? What makes a password strong then?
James (James_talking): A strong password usually has a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Plus, it shouldn't be something too obvious like your name or birthday.
Can you help me choose a password using password generator in my computer?
James (James_talking): Sure, no problem!
