Jordan (Jordan_talking): Before we dive into our next security drill, quick refresher—let’s talk malware.
James (James_talking): You mean like viruses?
Jordan (Jordan_talking): Viruses, sure—but there's more.\
We’ve got worms, which self-replicate and spread fast without user input.
James (James_talking): What about trojan horse?
Jordan (Jordan_talking): Good one. Trojans disguise themselves as legit software, trick users into installing them.
James (James_talking): And spyware?
Jordan (Jordan_talking): Spyware monitors users silently—like digital stalkers.\
Then there’s adware, keyloggers, rootkits... the usual suspects.
James (James_talking): And the scary one?
Jordan (Jordan_talking): Ransomware. Encrypts your files and demands payment for the decryption key. No guarantee they’ll give it back
npc: My files are gone!" "What’s happening?
James (James_talking): ...Was that part of the drill?
Jordan (Jordan_no): ...This isn't a drill.
