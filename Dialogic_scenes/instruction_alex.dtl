alex (alex_talking): Hey James, you're finally here.
James (James_no): Yeah, I’ve been trying to find the way through this section. It’s like a maze in here.
alex (alex_talking): If you want to proceed in this area, you’ll need to head to the South Room.
James (James_talking): South Room? Got it. What should I expect in there?
alex (alex_talking): It’s quiet… maybe too quiet. Just stay sharp. Good luck.
James (James_talking): Thanks, Alex. I’ll head there now.
