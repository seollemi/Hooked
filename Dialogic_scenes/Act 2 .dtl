“Your data has been encrypted. Pay 10 BTC within 3 hours or it’s gone forever.”

What’s happening? Legal just called. They’re locked out of everything.
Jordan (Jordan_talking):  We’ve been hit by ransomware. They’re demanding payment in Bitcoin.
Dana: Can we just pay and be done with it? We can't afford downtime today.
Jordan (Jordan_talking): There’s no guarantee they’ll return the files, ma’am. Paying might make us a future target. But isolation takes time.
- 🔌 [Isolate affected systems immediately]
	James (James_no): I think we should not pay them
	Jordan (Jordan_talking):  We isolate now. Cut off infected systems, trace the spread, and start restoring from last night’s backup.
	Dana: (sighs)\
Fine. Just fix this. And keep me updated every step of the way.
	James (James_talking): I’m unplugging the affected machines. Starting with the east wing.
	Jordan (Jordan_talking):  I’ll alert the rest of IT and lock down network access. We’ll identify the ransomware variant and kill it.
	Dana:  This better never happen again. Understood?
	James (James_talking): Understood, ma’am.
