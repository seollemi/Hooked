James (James_talking): We're locked out. Every shared file’s inaccessible… wait—
Jordan (Jordan_talking): (leans in, reading)\
“Your data has been encrypted. Pay 10 BTC within 3 hours or it’s gone forever.”
James (James_talking): It’s ransomware. No doubt.
Jordan (Jordan_talking): Then we’re on the clock. First step\: isolation. Before it spreads further.\
(Phone buzzes. Jordan answers. It’s CEO Dana Harper.)
Dana (Dana_talking): (voice through speaker)\
What’s happening? Legal just called. They’re locked out of everything.
Jordan (Jordan_talking): We’ve been hit by ransomware. They’re demanding payment in Bitcoin.
Dana (Dana_talking): Can we just pay and be done with it? We can't afford downtime today.
Jordan (Jordan_talking): There’s no guarantee they’ll return the files, ma’am. Paying might make us a future target. But isolation takes time.
- 🔌 [Isolate affected systems immediately]
	James (James_no): I think we should not pay them
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): We isolate now. Cut off infected systems, trace the spread, and start restoring from last night’s backup.
	Dana (Dana_talking): (sighs)\
Fine. Just fix this. And keep me updated every step of the way.
	James (James_talking): I’m unplugging the affected machines. Starting with the east wing.
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): I’ll alert the rest of IT and lock down network access. We’ll identify the ransomware variant and kill it.
	Dana (Dana_talking): This better never happen again. Understood?
	James (James_talking): Understood, ma’am.
	Narrator: ✅ You chose to isolate the affected systems.\
🔐 The ransomware was contained.\
💾 Files were successfully restored from secure backups.\
📉 Downtime was minimized. Future incidents now have a playbook.
- 💸 [Attempt to pay the ransom]
	James (James_talking): I'll go get the bitcoin!
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): (hesitant)\
It’s risky… but maybe we can get the files back quickly if we just pay.
	Dana (Dana_talking): Do it. We can't afford to lose hours — not today.
	James (James_talking): (worried)\
What if they vanish after we send it?
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): We’ve made the call. Let’s prepare the wallet.
	James (James_no): Still nothing. No decryption key. More systems are crashing.
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): (checks logs)\
It’s spreading again. They lied.
	Dana (Dana_talking): (furious, calling back)\
We paid — and things are worse! You said this would fix it!
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): I should’ve isolated the systems first… They’ve taken our money and escalated the attack.
	James (James_no): Backups are clean, but now we’ll need more time to rebuild everything.
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): We just bought ourselves more downtime. And painted a target on our backs.\
(The screen fades to red. A warning flashes\: “ALL SYSTEMS COMPROMISED.”)
	Narrator: ❌ You chose to pay the ransom.\
✖️ The attackers never returned your data.\
✖️ The ransomware spread to more machines.\
✖️ Rebuilding from backups will now take longer.\
⚠️ Lesson\: Never trust cybercriminals — isolate first, always.\
✅ Hint\: Isolating systems first can help you contain the damage and recover safely using backups.
