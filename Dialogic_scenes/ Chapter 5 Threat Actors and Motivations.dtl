James (James_talking): Hey Alex, who usually tries to attack companies like ours?
npc: There are different types of attackers, James. Some are from powerful groups — even government-sponsored teams, called nation-state actors.
James (James_talking): Wait, you mean real governments actually hack other people?
npc: Yes. They might try to steal sensitive information, spy on people, or even cause problems to weaken a country.
James (James_talking): Then there are cybercriminals. These are people or groups who attack mainly for money — like stealing credit card information or selling data.
James (James_talking): What about hacktivists? I've heard that word online.
npc: Good question. Hacktivists are attackers who do it for a cause. They want to send a political message — maybe to protest something or expose wrongdoings.
James (James_talking): And those random hackers... the ones that just cause chaos?
npc: Yeah. Some attackers aren’t organized. They're individuals or small groups who hack just for fun, fame, or because they’re bored
npc: Always remember, James — every attacker has a reason. If you understand their motivation, you can guess what they might target.
