Narrator: [6\:45 AM – Monday]\
Another day in the life of Alex Carter, cybersecurity intern at NovaShield. The calm before the code storm.
James (James_talking): (Groggy) Ugh… Monday already? Feels like I just closed my eyes.\
Big day today. Product launch… Maybe today’s the day I finally prove I belong here.
Ava: Good morning, Alex. The weather is clear, and your meeting with NovaShield begins in two hours. Would you like me to order your usual coffee?
James (James_talking): Not today, Ava. Gotta save money… Startup salary life.
