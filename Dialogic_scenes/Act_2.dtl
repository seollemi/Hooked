“Your data has been encrypted. Pay 10 BTC within 3 hours or it’s gone forever.”
James (James_talking): It’s ransomware. No doubt.

Jordan (Jordan_talking): Then we’re on the clock. First step\: isolation. Before it spreads further.

Dana (Dana_talking): What’s happening? Legal just called. They’re locked out of everything.

Jordan (Jordan_talking): We’ve been hit by ransomware. They’re demanding payment in Bitcoin.
[voice path="res://sounds/Voice_act/Dana/Dana2.wav" volume="2.0" bus="SFX"]
Dana (Dana_talking): Can we just pay and be done with it? We can't afford downtime today.
[voice path="res://sounds/Voice_act/Act_2_vn/Jordan_act2.4.wav" volume="-1.0" bus="SFX"]
Jordan (Jordan_talking): There’s no guarantee they’ll return the files, ma’am. Paying might make us a future target. But isolation takes time.
Narrator: What should Jordan do?
- 🔌 [Isolate affected systems immediately]
	James (James_no): I think we should not pay them
	[voice path="res://sounds/Voice_act/Act_2_vn/Jordan_act2.5.wav" volume="-1.0" bus="SFX"]
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): We isolate now. Cut off infected systems, trace the spread, and start restoring from last night’s backup.
	[voice path="res://sounds/Voice_act/Dana/Dana3.wav" volume="2.0" bus="SFX"]
	Dana (Dana_no): (sighs)\
Fine. Just fix this. And keep me updated every step of the way.
	James (James_talking): I’m unplugging the affected machines. Starting with the east wing.

	[voice path="res://sounds/Voice_act/Act_2_vn/Jordan_act2.6.wav" volume="-1.0" bus="SFX"]
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): I’ll alert the rest of IT and lock down network access. We’ll identify the ransomware variant
	[voice path="res://sounds/Voice_act/Dana/Dana4.wav" volume="2.0" bus="SFX"]
	Dana (Dana_talking): This better never happen again. Understood?

	Jordan (Jordan_talking): Understood, ma’am.

	Narrator: ✅ You chose to isolate the affected systems.\
🔐 The ransomware was contained.\
💾 Files were successfully restored from secure backups.\
📉 Downtime was minimized. Future incidents now have a playbook.
- 💸 [Attempt to pay the ransom]
	James (James_talking): I'll go get the bitcoin!
	[voice path="res://sounds/Voice_act/Act_2_vn/Jordan_act2.8.wav" volume="-1.0" bus="SFX"]
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): (hesitant)\
It’s risky… but maybe we can get the files back quickly if we just pay.
	[voice path="res://sounds/Voice_act/Dana/Dana5.wav" volume="2.0" bus="SFX"]
	Dana (Dana_talking): Do it. We can't afford to lose hours — not today.
	James (James_talking): (worried)\
What if they vanish after we send it?
	[voice path="res://sounds/Voice_act/Act_2_vn/Jordan_act2.9.wav" volume="-1.0" bus="SFX"]
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): We’ve made the call. Let’s prepare the wallet.
	James (James_no): Still nothing. No decryption key. More systems are crashing.

It’s spreading again. They lied.
	[voice path="res://sounds/Voice_act/Dana/dana6.wav" volume="2.0" bus="SFX"]
	Dana (Dana_no): (furious)\
We paid — and things are worse! You said this would fix it!
	[voice path="res://sounds/Voice_act/Act_2_vn/Jordan_act2.11.wav" volume="-1.0" bus="SFX"]
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): I should’ve isolated the systems first… They’ve taken our money and escalated the attack.
	James (James_no): Backups are clean, but now we’ll need more time to rebuild everything.
	[voice path="res://sounds/Voice_act/Act_2_vn/Jordan_act2.13.wav" volume="-1.0" bus="SFX"]
	Jordan (Jordan_talking): We just bought ourselves more downtime. And painted a target on our backs.

	Narrator: ❌ You chose to pay the ransom.\
✖️ The attackers never returned your data.\
✖️ The ransomware spread to more machines.\
✖️ Rebuilding from backups will now take longer.\
⚠️ Lesson\: Never trust cybercriminals — isolate first, always.\
✅ Hint\: Isolating systems first can help you contain the damage and recover safely using backups.
