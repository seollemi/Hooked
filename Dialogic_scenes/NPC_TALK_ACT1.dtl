Jordan: Hey there! You must be the new guy. James, right?
James: Yeah, uh, First day nerves, you know?
James: Good to meet you, Jordan. Honestly, I have no idea where to even start.
Jordan: That’s normal. First rule around here — ask questions. No one expects you to know everything on Day One.
James: Good to hear. I was worried I'd mess something up
Jordan: Messing up is half the job. Learning from it is the other half. Come on
Jordan: You're actually assigned to that desk over there — bottom far right corner. You’ll be next to me. Good spot — less noise, more coffee let me know if you need anything.
James: Thanks. I really appreciate it
